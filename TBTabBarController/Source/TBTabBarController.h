/**
 * @abstract `TBTabBarController` is a view controller designed to manage and display multiple child view controllers
 * using a tab bar. What makes it unique is its ability to support both vertical and horizontal tab bar layouts,
 * offering flexibility in how your app's navigation is presented.
 * @discussion It's important to note that TBTabBarController actually incorporates two tab bars within its design. 
 * The first tab bar is positioned horizontally and resides at the bottom of the view, while the second tab bar is oriented vertically
 * and can be displayed either on the left or right side of the screen. The choice between horizontal and vertical tab bar presentation
 * depends on factors like the view's size or the horizontal size class.
 * By default, the controller follows the horizontal size classes to determine which tab bar layout to use.
 * However, you have the option to customize this behavior and manually specify whether the horizontal or vertical tab bar
 * should be displayed, giving you full control over your app's user interface.
