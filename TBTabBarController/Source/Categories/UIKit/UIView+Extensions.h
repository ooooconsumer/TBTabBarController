/**
 * @abstract A display scale.
 * @discussion Some iPhone models (or rather 5,5" Plus models and 12 Mini) have non-integer display scale value (≈@2.608x). This applies only for real devices and not to simulators. So, because of this, some lines, separators, icons and other graphics that requires pixel-perfect design may be displaying wrong. This computed property solves this problem by getting current screen's native scale instead of trait collection's display scale which may be only integer value like @1x, @2x and so on.
 * @note If the current view does not have a window then it uses main screen's window native scale value.
