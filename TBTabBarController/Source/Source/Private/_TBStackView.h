/**
 * @abstract A private class that represents a custom stack view used for tab bar layout within the `TBTabBarController` framework.
 * @discussion This class is used internally to provide fine-grained control over the positioning and distribution of tab bar items.
 * The use of this custom stack view allows for pixel-accurate positioning and customized distribution rules, which are essential
 * for `TBTabBarController's` specific layout requirements. 
 * Advantages:
 * **Pixel-Accurate Positioning:** The `_TBStackView` is designed to handle pixel-accurate layout, 
 * ensuring that items are positioned precisely, especially for devices with varying screen scales.
 * This level of control is essential for tab bars where pixel-perfect alignment is crucial.
 * **Custom Distribution Rules:** The custom stack view allows the definition of specific distribution rules for pixel distribution. 
 * It provides flexibility in how undistributed pixels are allocated between items, which can be useful for creating custom layouts
 * based on the number of tabs and available space.
